Checks (each user, you can do all this once all your services are running)(check all this for the root user too, root has a different .bashrc than the other users) - 

sudo visudo 
(keep this open on each box at all times)
see if there are any users that are not supposed to be there

cd /etc and check if theres a file that isn’t one of these, bad

Check the sudoers file for users that shouldn’t be there

Check the sudoers.d/ directory for users that shouldn’t be there
Check to make sure all users are consistent with those in the blue team packet
cd ~ (check for root user too)
.bashrc
.profile
Might be multiple so look around

cd ~/.ssh/ (check for root user too)
if you see any files named /authorized_keys*, delete them
