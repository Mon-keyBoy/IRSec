Looking as users and their groups - 
id [user number/name]: lists users on the current device, given a user number is will display info only on that user 
ex: id -> lists users, id 0 -> root info, id nobody -> nobody info,id sshd

Finding and removing SUID binaries put by redteam - 
find / \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f -exec file {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -v ELF (to look for them)
chmod a-s /path/to/binary (remove SUID)

Blocking an IP with IPtables - 
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s <IP> -j DROP

Getting ping back up - 
echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all

Check if services are running - 
systemctl status <service>

Restart a service if its down - 
systemctl restart <service>

List all failed services - 
sudo systemctl --failed

List all running services (look for ones that shouldn’t be running) (like ping since its not a service) -
sudo systemctl list-units --type=service
sudo systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running

List running processes - 
ps Command: The ps command lists running processes.

ps aux

a: shows processes for all users
u: displays the process owner
x: shows processes not attached to a terminal

Always have this open - 
sudo visudo

Remove a user from a group (debian only) - 
sudo deluser <username> <groupname>

Find the process ID of a given process - 
sudo pgrep <process_name>

Kill/Disable/Stop a given process ID - 
sudo pkill -9(SIGTERM) <PID>

Killing a process does not disable it, meaning that if it is configured right, it will start right back up
sudo systemctl disable <service-name> (then kill/stop it)
sudo systemctl stop <service-name> 

Find and kill the PID of a given process - 
kill $(pgrep <process_name>)

Looking for bad/altered files - 
sudo apt install debsums
sudo debsums | grep -v 'OK$' 

If you try to modify files and it says operation not permitted - 
lsattr (lists all permissions on the file like i for immutable)
sudo chattr -i <filename> (makes the file mutable again)

To lock users (change shadow hash) - 
sudo usermod -L <username>
sudo usermod -U <username> (To unlock)

netstat - 
netstat -tulpen					shows only TCP/UDP connections with numeric IPs/ports, making it easier to spot unfamiliar or suspicious connections quickly.
ss -peanut					more detailed version of ^^
netstat -tulpen | grep ‘:22’			if you see many connections form the same IP, it's probably a brute-force attack, block that IP
watch -n 2 'netstat -tulpen			watch -n 2 will refresh the netstat output every 2 seconds, helping you monitor connections in near real-time.
netstat -ant | grep ESTABLISHED		shows established tcp connections

To check banned IPs with fail2ban - 
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd

Getting rid of LD_preload rootkit - 
sudo busybox rm /etc/ld.so.preload
go into etc to look for the LD-preload(s)


Accessing Webmin - 
web GUI for IPtables
<ip of computer>:10000
login credentials of the box
